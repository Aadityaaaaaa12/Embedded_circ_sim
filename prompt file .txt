rough

peripheral gui prompt:
i would like to start the simulation with a panel which reads Embedded circuit simulator
and individual buttons which reads led. 
now if i press on the button it should ask me for the pins that it should be connected too. for example if you press on led button it should ask me to which pin i want to connect the anode and the cathode to, and the coour of the led  and then initialize it that way. 

right now i just write in the code which led i want to connect to connect to which pins. in thie above situation the user will chose i am unsure how to initailize the leds on the spot once the user chooses them.
in the simulator file this is how i declare the peripherals and define their pins etc using the connect method
seven_seg_display sseg = new seven_seg_display();
		LED led_1 = new LED();
        Resistor resistor_1 = new Resistor();
		LED led_2 = new LED("blue");
        Resistor resistor_2 = new Resistor(250);
		
		resistor_1.connect(pins.p2_1, ground);  
        led_1.connect(pins.p2_1,pins.p2_2);
		
		resistor_2.connect(pins.p2_3, ground);  
        led_2.connect(pins.p2_3,pins.p2_4);
		sseg.connect(pins.p2_0,pins.p1_0 ,pins.p1_1 ,pins.p1_2 ,pins.p1_3,pins.p1_4 ,pins.p1_5 ,pins.p1_6);

make changes to the simulator code such that
